# Release Process

This document provides step-by-step instructions for releasing new versions of the golang-crossbuild project.

## Overview

This project follows the Golang versioning scheme, creating a GitHub Release for each specific Golang version. The release process ensures backward compatibility by maintaining separate branches for different Go versions.

We support the last two newer major versions, the same as the official Golang release [policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy):

> Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases. For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release. We fix critical problems, including critical security problems, in supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions (for example, Go 1.6.1, Go 1.6.2, and so on).

## 🤖 Primary Release Process: New Minor Go Version

This is the most common release scenario and it's fully automated using [updatecli](https://www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/quick-start/).

The updatecli manifest can be found at:
* [.github/updatecli.d/bump-golang.yml](.github/updatecli.d/bump-golang.yml)

There are two GitHub workflows:
* [.github/workflows/bump-golang.yml](.github/workflows/bump-golang.yml) for updating the `main` branch.
* [.github/workflows/bump-golang-previous.yml](.github/workflows/bump-golang-previous.yml) for updating the previous active major Go version.

## 🚀 New Major Go Version

Follow these steps when a new major Go version is [released](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release).

### Prerequisites
- New Major Go version has been officially released or even for RCs.
- You have write access to the repository
- You're familiar with the current Go version in use

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Prepare Version Branch
Create a branch for the previous major Go version to maintain backward compatibility.

**Example**: If upgrading from Go 1.24 to Go 1.25:
```bash
# Create branch for previous version (1.24)
git checkout main
git checkout -b 1.24
git push origin 1.24
```

#### 2. Update Core Version Files
Update the Go version in the main configuration files:

- **File**: `.go-version`
  - Update to the new Go version (e.g., `1.25.0`)

- **File**: `go/Makefile.common` (line 5)
  - Update the Docker tag to match the new version

#### 3. Run Version Bump Script
Execute the automated version bump script:
```bash
.github/updatecli.d/bump-go-release-version.sh "$(cat .go-version)"
```

#### 4. Update Documentation
- **File**: `README.md`
  - Update all version references to the new Go version

#### 5. Update GitHub Workflows
- **File**: `.github/workflows/bump-golang.yml`
  - Update `go-minor` value to new minor version (e.g., `1.25`)

- **File**: `.github/workflows/bump-golang-previous.yml`
  - Update `go-minor` to previous minor version (e.g., `1.24`)
  - Update `branch` value to previous minor version (e.g., `1.24`)

#### 6. Configure Backport Support
- **File**: `.mergify.yml`
  - Add entry for new backport label: `backport-v1.24` (using previous version)

- **GitHub Labels**
  - Create new label at: https://github.com/elastic/golang-crossbuild/labels
  - Label name: `backport-v1.24` (using previous version)

#### 7. Commit and Create Pull Request in the `main` branch
```bash
git checkout main
git add -u
git commit -m "Update to Go 1.25.0"  # Use actual version
```

Create a Pull Request with:
- **Title**: `Update to Go 1.25.0`
- **Description**: Brief summary of the Go version update

#### 8. Merge and Release
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Merge the Pull Request
- The automation will automatically release the Docker images

> **⚠️ Important Note**: Due to changes in Debian package repositories, Docker images for previous Go versions may stop working over time.

### Example Scenario
```
Current State: Go 1.24 on main branch
New Release: Go 1.25

Actions:
1. Create branch "1.24" from main
2. Update main branch to Go 1.25
3. Follow steps 2-8 above
```

## 🔧 Specialized Release Processes

### NPCAP Release
For detailed instructions on releasing NPCAP versions, see the dedicated [NPCAP documentation](./NPCAP.md).

### FPM Release
> **📋 Status**: Not actively released (deprecated for several years)  
> **Action**: To be documented when needed

### LLVM Apple Release  
> **📋 Status**: Infrequent releases (approximately every 3 years)  
> **Action**: To be documented when needed

## 🔄 Hotfix Process: Update Existing Released Version

Use this process for critical fixes to already-released versions.

### Prerequisites
- Existing release tag (e.g., `v1.25.1`)
- Critical fix that needs backporting
- Understanding of git branching and cherry-picking

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Create Hotfix Branch
Create a maintenance branch for the specific version:
```bash
# Example for version 1.25.1
git checkout v1.25.1
git checkout -b 1.25.1.x  # 'x' is literal, not a placeholder
git push upstream 1.25.1.x
```

#### 2. Apply Your Changes

1. Ensure your original PR is merged to main
2. Comment on the PR: `@mergifyio backport 1.25.1.x`
3. Mergify will automatically create a backport PR
4. Review and merge the backport PR when CI passes

#### 3. Release Process
- Merge the hotfix PR
- The automation will handle the release process
- Verify the new images are published

### Example Hotfix Scenario
```
Scenario: Critical security fix needed for Go 1.25.1

Steps:
1. git checkout v1.25.1
2. git checkout -b 1.25.1.x
3. git push upstream 1.25.1.x
4. Apply fix via backport or manual PR
5. Merge when CI passes
```

## 📚 Quick Reference

### File Locations
| Component | File Path |
|-----------|-----------|
| Go Version | `.go-version` |
| Docker Tag | `go/Makefile.common` (line 5) |
| Main Workflow | `.github/workflows/bump-golang.yml` |
| Previous Workflow | `.github/workflows/bump-golang-previous.yml` |
| Mergify Config | `.mergify.yml` |
| Version Bump Script | `.github/updatecli.d/bump-go-release-version.sh` |

### Branch Naming Convention
- **Main development**: `main`
- **Version branches**: `1.23`, `1.24` (major.minor format)
- **Hotfix branches**: `1.25.1.x` (major.minor.patch.x format)

### Automation
- **Docker Images**: Released automatically on PR merge
- **Backports**: Available via Mergify (`@mergifyio backport <branch>`)
- **CI/CD**: All releases go through automated testing

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CI Failures**: Ensure all version references are updated consistently
2. **Docker Build Errors**: Check Debian package repository availability
3. **Backport Conflicts**: Resolve manually and create new PR
4. **Missing Labels**: Create GitHub labels before using backport commands

### Support
- Check existing GitHub issues and PRs for similar problems
- Review CI logs for specific error messages
- Consult team members for complex release scenarios
